sports bra, having enough support while you’re exercising should be your first priority.</p><p>While it’s unlikely that it will keep your breasts completely still, a good bra should soften the bouncing by more than 50 per cent, according to fitness experts.</p><h2><strong>How do I choose a sports bra for heavy breasts?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>If you’re wearing anything above a C cup, there a few things to keep in mind to avoid painful boob bouncing.</p><p>Ditch the traditional sports bra, which usually has a single flat panel and opt for one with two separate cups that will give you decent support.</p><p>You’ll also want to look out for options with higher armholes and decent coverage at the front (avoid plunging necklines), so that your breasts aren’t spilling out of the neckline or underarm.</p><p>Finally, pick bras with wide straps that will evenly distribute weight without digging into your shoulders and provide greater comfort compared to narrow ones.</p><h2><strong>How should a high impact sports bra fit?</strong></h2><p>Getting your measurements wrong can lead to sagging, back or neck pain and even scarring, so it’s important to get a sports bra that is right for you.</p><p>It should feel a lot more close fitting than your ordinary underwear although sizes are the same.</p><p>As a general rule of thumb, you should just about be able to get a finger under the supportive lower cuff of the bra, and it should be tight without cutting into your skin.</p><p>Similarly, make sure the straps don’t slip off or dig into your shoulder during high-impact activities.</p><p>If you feel the band is riding up in the front or pulling at the back, it probably means it’s not the right size and you’re not getting the full benefit of support.</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt
