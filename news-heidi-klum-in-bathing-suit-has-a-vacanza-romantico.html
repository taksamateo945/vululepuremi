Klum, 50, shared pictures of herself piloting a motorboat while wearing a black bathing suit, hat, and sunglasses, with a big smile on her face. In another snap Kaulitz takes over the wheel while Klum relaxes and soaks up the sun and scenery. "Vacanza romantico ‚ù§Ô∏èüáÆüáπ," she captioned the post. How does she stay so fit?</span> <span>Read on to see 5 ways </span><span>Klum</span><span> stays in shape and the photos that prove they work.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-1492955890.jpg><p><span>Klum starts the day with coffee and running on the treadmill. "I wake up at 6am," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I make breakfast for my four kids, do the school run, then start work at my home, office or studio. The first thing that passes my lips is coffee. The sweet nectar of the gods. My exercise routine is all over the place. My life does not allow for a routine! So I run on my treadmill at home."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-1493397307.jpg><p><span>Klum's go-to foods are kohlrabi and smoothies. "My fridge is always filled with kohlrabi," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "It's yummy ‚Äì raw or cooked. You just peel and eat it. I have a fresh smoothie every morning and take Perfectil Skin, Hair, Nails supplements for a boost. The last treatment I had was a body scrub at Beverly Hot Springs. It's the best one I've ever had. They get off all your dead skin, I love it!"</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Klum's mindset is to keep in shape year-round. "I pretend it's bikini season all year and regularly make healthy decisions," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "My favorite workout is a long run along the Westside Highway, which stretches along the Hudson River in New York City‚Ä¶it's a beautiful path, and you always feel surrounded by such an amazing community. You see the same people running every morning, and they inspire me to keep going. That and knowing there is a Starbucks coffee at the end of the route!"</span></p><p><span>Klum doesn't rely on structured workouts to get her daily exercise in. "I like to try and incorporate exercise into my daily life whenever I can‚Äîwhich requires some creativity," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Sometimes I jump on the trampoline with my kids or take a hike with my dogs in the canyon by my house. Sometimes I run for 30 minutes on my treadmill, but I prefer to be outdoors. When I'm traveling, it could be doing a few sit-ups in my hotel room before I head to work."</span></p><p><span>Klum has made it clear over the years she never diets‚Äîinstead, the whole family focused on healthy balance. "There is no go-to," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Every day we cook something different; we cook fresh everyday so it's hard to say a go-to when you cook for a family ‚Äì you know I have four kids. Like, Mondays I'll have meatballs with pasta and vegetables ‚Äì there's always a vegetable ‚Äì or we have fish with green beans and mashed potatoes and then we have schnitzel with broccoli and spaghetti squash. Every day is something different. It's not like salad and a piece of chicken every day ‚Äì my kids would really not appreciate that."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkoZ2ZmbZut8uupGahnmKvosDHoqWgZaOqtrV5x5qqZpldq66krc2zmGaqn6Kur8DInKZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
