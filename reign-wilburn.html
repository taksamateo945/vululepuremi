id=Reign_Wilburns_parents_began_their_relationship_sometime_in_2016>Reign Wilburn’s parents began their relationship sometime in 2016</span></h2><p>Reign Wilburn’s parents, Future and Eliza Seraphin, entered into a relationship around 2016.</p><p>However, it was a relatively short-lived connection, lasting approximately two years.</p><p>From available information, their relationship seemed to be primarily physical, lacking indications of a deep emotional connection.</p><p>There is no evidence to suggest that the couple was exclusive during this time.</p><p>The relationship ultimately came to an end around 2018, coinciding with the year Eliza became pregnant with Reign.</p><p>Despite the circumstances, Eliza carried the pregnancy to full term and gave birth to her daughter on April 19, 2019.</p><p>Eliza held an immense love for her child from the very beginning, choosing to name her Reign Wilburn, taking her famous father’s surname.</p><p>Eliza made efforts to involve her ex-boyfriend in their child’s life, but this decision led to numerous challenges and conflicts between them.</p><p>The situation surrounding co-parenting posed difficulties for the former couple and likely contributed to the complexities of their relationship dynamics.</p><h2><span id=Reigns_father_initially_refused_to_acknowledge_the_paternity>Reign’s father initially refused to acknowledge the paternity</span></h2><p>The arrival of a child is typically a time of great happiness for parents, but unfortunately, this hasn’t been the case for Reign Wilburn and her parents.</p><p>Ever since her birth, her parents have been embroiled in numerous disputes.</p><p>Initially, Reign’s father denied his paternity and neglected his responsibility to provide for her.</p><p>However, after undergoing a DNA test that confirmed his paternity, a new wave of conflicts emerged.</p><p>The rapper accused Reign’s mother of<a href=#> intentionally becoming pregnant for financial gain.</a></p><p>He alleged that she had researched the amount of child support he paid to his other children’s mothers and referred to Reign as a “check baby.”</p><p>In addition, Future claimed that Eliza, Reign’s mother, had been exploiting their intimate encounters for attention and popularity, characterizing her as both violent and obsessively fixated on him.</p><p>As a result, he took legal action against her, citing invasion of privacy and defamation.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the joyous occasion of Reign’s birth has been overshadowed by these ongoing disputes between her parents.</p><h2><span id=Eliza_Seraphin_Sued_Future>Eliza Seraphin Sued Future</span></h2><p>Eliza Seraphin, undeterred by Future’s allegations, took a proactive <a href=#>stance and initiated several lawsuits,</a> primarily seeking child support from him.</p><p>Additionally, she filed a defamation lawsuit against her former partner, accusing him of spreading falsehoods about her mental health and legal background, among other things.</p><p>Eliza also claimed that Future was not fulfilling his responsibilities in supporting their child.</p><p>Utilizing her Instagram account, Eliza voiced her concerns and referred to Future as a neglectful father who had not been present in their daughter’s life during her first year.</p><p>She used her platform to rally women together, encouraging them to unite against abuse and stand up for their rights.</p><p>Eliza Seraphin demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity, asserting her rights and advocating for her daughter’s welfare.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CmmPRzvL-r8/?hl=en</p><h2><span id=Currently_Reign_Wilburn_resides_with_her_mother_and_her_father_provides_child_support>Currently, Reign Wilburn resides with her mother, and her father provides child support.</span></h2><p>The Eliza and Future saga, which unfolded from 2020 to 2022, was filled with scandal.</p><p>However, things have been relatively quiet in 2023, suggesting a potential ceasefire between the parties involved.</p><p>Currently, Reign Wilburn resides in Florida with her mother, while her father pays a monthly child support of $3200.</p><p>Initially, Future offered to provide $450 and later $1000, but both offers were rejected by Reign’s mother.</p><p>Eventually, the court-mandated the monthly payment of $3200, which her mother reluctantly accepted.</p><p>Despite this, she continues to seek additional support, as she believes Future’s wealth surpasses what he has disclosed.</p><p>There is no evidence to suggest that Reign has ever met her father.</p><p>A meeting was supposedly arranged in 2022, but he failed to show up, further complicating their relationship.</p><h2><span id=Reign_Wilburn_career>Reign Wilburn career</span></h2><p>Reign Wilburn’s future path is still uncertain at this early stage, but there is a possibility she may venture into the modeling industry or pursue other avenues within showbiz.</p><p>Already, the young girl has her own Instagram account managed by her mother, showcasing adorable pictures of her.</p><p>She has even collaborated with various brands for sponsored posts.</p><p>Aside from her interest in modeling, Reign is exploring ballet and exhibits a fondness for animals, as evidenced by her visits to the zoo.</p><p>She enjoys a privileged lifestyle, often adorned in designer outfits from brands like kid couture.</p><p>Currently, Reign’s Instagram page boasts nearly 20k followers, reflecting a growing online presence.</p><p><img decoding=async
