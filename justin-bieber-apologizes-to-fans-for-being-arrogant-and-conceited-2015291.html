Why I say I was ‘pretending’ is often we pretend to be something we’re not as a cover up of what we’re truly feeling inside. And there was a lot of feelings going on in there,” he continued. “Just being young and growing up in this business is hard. Just growing up in general is hard,” he added.</p><p>“I just felt awkward up there. I felt like people were judging me, and I really want people to know how much I care, how much I care about people, and how I’m not that person to say, ‘I don’t give a f—,’ you know? I’m not that kid, I’m a person who genuinely cares,” he continued.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“And although what’s happened in the past has happened, I just want to make the best impression on people and be kind and loving and gentle and soft.
