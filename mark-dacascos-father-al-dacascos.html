This happened because, until 1967, there were no institutional procedures anywhere in the US to assist him in learning the skills required to manage a martial arts business. Over time, he began to reshape his martial art through the exchange of techniques between instructors of a group of Chinese martial artists in San Fransisco.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Al also realized he needed to improve his communication skills. Furthermore, he was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">acknowledged as</a> one of the “Masters to Wesley Snipes” in the first tribute to the 20th-century martial arts masters in August 1998 on national television by Turner Network Television. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Additionally, Dacascos, an eighth-degree Black Belt, has won more than 200 Championships and has graced the pages of numerous martial arts publications over the years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mark Dacascos’ father exhibits a form of KAJUKENBO that combines the martial arts of China and the Philippines with the traditional KAJUKENBO system.
