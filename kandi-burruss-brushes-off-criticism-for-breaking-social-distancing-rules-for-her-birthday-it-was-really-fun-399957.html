While the city of Atlanta recently lifted their stay at home order, the Real Housewives of Atlanta starâ€™s fans were still upset about the celebration she had considering the CDC guidelines that people should still practice social distancing.</p><p>On Kandiâ€™s birthday, she was able to celebrate with friends and family. However, while looking at video of the gathering â€” viewers noticed that many people were either not wearing a mask at all or wearing it incorrectly.</p><p>Others also questioned why sheâ€™d let so many friends be in close vicinity knowing that she has a baby that is less than a year old.</p><p>One commentator wrote: â€˜Stop spreading the virus smhðŸ¤§â€™</p><p>Another added: â€˜I donâ€™t understand how yâ€™all wonâ€™t just sit out one birthday for safetyðŸ’€â€™</p><p>â€˜Lol just take the mask off if you ainâ€™t gonna wear it though,â€™ wrote another social media user.</p><p>A fan who commented on a post from a RHOA fan page said: â€˜This is why black people are getting this at an alarming rate. You are rich. You could have easily stayed in your million dollar mansion and celebrated at a later time. Celebrities are so selfish.â€™</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CATo2SPFPWA/?</a></p><p>While speaking to Loni Love on Instagram Live, Kandi addressed the backlash and is brushing it off.</p><p>â€˜My husband Todd and Don Juan put together this surprise birthday party for me and it was called the â€˜Mask Onâ€™ party. I was like Oh yâ€™all just tryna give it away I see! But yeah it was really fun. I hadnâ€™t seen my family and friends in so long I had got overly excited and I was hugging everybody. And I know everybody was mad like â€˜youâ€™re not social distancing.â€™ And I was like I have not seen them in forever, okay? And a lot of my friends had been quarantined like, for months so we were just so happy to be out the house for real.â€™</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Hopefully, Kandi is a bit more careful when having or going to gatherings during this scary time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblrultYybrKuqpajAbq7RrqqhnaNivKeyjJypoqyZmLa0uYyfpqtlkqeyorfIp55mq5%2BYtqK4jJ2grKyRo7CqusZmqa6klah6p7vRZp%2Beql2XtrPAx52YsmWZqXq4rdJmqZ6ZnKHGbrLUp2RscWlugnh7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
