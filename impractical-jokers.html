Fans are specifically interested in Sal as not much is known about his personal life. There are no significant records of his dating life, which made people think he might be gay.</p><p>Back in 2014, Sal Vulcano left thousands of his fans shocked by admitting to being gay. However, Murray also confessed to being gay in the same interview which aired on national television.</p><p>Sal then revealed a centered tactic to help Murray come out and declare his orientation and sexual preferences. However, this was simply a staged thing. To this day, Sal’s sexual orientation and love life remain a mystery.</p><p>Joe is the only impractical joker who is married. Brian has a long history of complicated relationships that have become running gags on the show. Murray, on the other hand, is engaged yet to get married.</p><h2><strong>Are Impractical Jokers Staged?</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest questions about the hit TV show is if it is fake or real. The show is undeniably funny and has a top rating, making fans wonder if it is staged. According to the comedians, every prank is 100% real.</p><p>The show works because they are natural reactions to strangers who do not know they are on camera. While the pranks remain authentic, <a href=#>producers sometimes intervene</a> if an eager fan poses a threat to the scene.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to ensuring that everything is authentic is that people recognize them due to their fame. They perform in New York, a city with over 8 million people. Therefore, the jokers shuffle them along, reset, and find someone else when someone recognizes them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7rEsKquqJSWwaa%2FjZympmeZor2zrcKtoJyZnGK3sLfEq6po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
