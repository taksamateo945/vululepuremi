I was at a dentist having him do mock-ups. I thought about it, man. There is so much pressure to just be perfect. You can fix everything. For me, I made the effort to say ‘This is who I am.’ I am not perfect. I do not want to try to be perfect. At this point, I do not think my kids would recognize me without it. They would be like, ‘Who is this stranger in the house? Call 911!”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>So what do you think?
