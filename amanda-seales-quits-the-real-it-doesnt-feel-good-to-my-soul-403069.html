The now-former host explained why she is choosing not to return.</p><p>Viewers have seen Amanda clash with her co-stars over her differing opinions on the multi-cultural show when she was a stand-in cast member. When it was announced that she would be the permanent new voice in place of Tamar Braxton, fans felt that it wouldn’t last long.</p><p>Amanda’s passionate personality backed with her strong educational background is a force that some felt didn’t mesh with The Real that did talk about serious issues, but was more on the lighter side.</p><p>‘My contract is up at&nbsp;The Real, and I didn’t renew it. It doesn’t feel good to my soul to be at a place where I can not speak to my people the way they need to be spoken to. And where the people that are speaking to me in despairing ways are not being handled. I’m not at a space where, as a full black woman, I can have my voice and my co-workers also have their voices, and where the people at the top are not respecting the necessity for black voices to be at the top, too.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CA81zuqJASC/</a></p><p>However, she wanted to make it clear that she did not leave because she is clashing with Loni Love.</p><p>Seales took to her Instagram Story to say: ‘Do not try to create some false dissention between me and the co-hosts of&nbsp;The Real. Y’all so f—ing corny. There is a whole pandemic and an uprising going on, and you still can’t find s— else to do but try and create some kind of conflict that doesn’t exist? I did not unfollow Loni Love. I haven’t unfollowed anybody. What ya’ll don’t understand is grown women do grown women business. That’s what y’all don’t understand, and what I gotta do with my business ain’t got nothing to do with them sisters.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about Amanda’s announcement?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRoq6vsMBmqp6ZnJrAbr3UoqusZaSdsm6%2BxJqjZqGkYrGwsdKnq2aelZq5brPOqJtmrJ9iurp50qispWVkZYBxgpho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
