One of the guests was the British designer Alexa Chung.</p><p>For the evening, the former model and friend of the jewelry brand Boucheron tried on a knitted set from the Adidas x Gucci collection, consisting of a lemon midi skirt and a cardigan embellished with three stripes, which she complemented with retro-style pumps and a new Gucci it-bag – Blondie from Maison’s archives. El Fanning, for example, already loves and wears this one.</p><p>The Boucheron Quatre collection first saw the light in 2004 and has since become the hallmark of the Maison. The key feature of the line is the combination of four graphic textures, Boucheron’s iconic architectural motifs: Grosgrain, Diamond Line, Double Gaudron, and Clou de Paris.</p><p>The Quatre collection has been replenished with laconic novelties. Brides will definitely appreciate thin yellow, rose, and white gold engagement rings, complemented by a pavé diamond band.</p><p>The house has prepared interesting jewelry not only for those who are waiting for the wedding. Boucheron pendants in the form of rings on thin chains are available in yellow and rose gold, with diamonds or brown PVD-coated bands.</p><p>Well, for everyone who is afraid to pierce their ears, there are wide ear cuffs made of precious white metal, which are suitable for both daily wear and special occasions.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRobK5rYycn66ml2LEpq3RrGSapl2auaazwKerZquVqXqnvs6mZK2gmah6tMHMppyrq12ivLTAjJymr52kmrFur86lo5qan6eutbXOp2RuamNpfXZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
