Just ask New England Patriots quarterback Bailey Zappe.</p><p>The 25-year-old concluded the 2023 season as New England's starting quarterback, making half-a-dozen starts to close out the campaign. Over that span, he was 2-4, throwing six touchdown passes against seven interceptions.</p><p>Zappe got his shot to show he could be New England's long-term quarterback, but things didn't go so well.</p><p>Now, the landscape is vastly different in Boston. There's a new head coach in Jerod Mayo and a trio of new quarterbacks in veteran Jacoby Brissett and rookies Drake Maye and Joe Milton.</p><p>For his part, Brissett <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> that he's been impressed by what Zappe brings to the table in Beantown.</p><p>"Man, I like Zap a lot. He just goes out there and competes," he said. "And, the elephant in the roomâ€¦this is a tough situation for him, and he's accepted that. He's going out there every day, and competed, and is doing a really good job, and making a lot of plays. I'm excited for his growth."</p><p>Maye, who was the third overall pick in this year's draft, is the future in New England. Brissett, who has started 48 games for five teams over eight professional seasons, is probably the present. Milton is a raw prospect, but his physical tools are impressive.</p><p>The Patriots may well carry four quarterbacks into training camp, but there's no chance a quartet makes the 53-man roster.</p><p>And right now, Zappe appears to be the odd man out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmt9cn6Mp52lZaaawaa%2BwKeqZq%2BYpHqku9Slm2aemaOxbsDHnqSsnZyrsrR5zqdkraCVYr%2Bwv9OeqWaapZevrbGMoqVmrKKWtq%2B1zaBknJmdpcA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
