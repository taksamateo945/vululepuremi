She lost a lot of weight by making changes to her diet and starting a fitness routine. But what motivated her to drastically change her life?</p><p>She signed up for WW and is now an ambassador for the weight loss group.</p><p>Alison explained: “This is something I wanted to achieve for a long time and I haven’t managed it on my own, so I went to my local workshop and met my lovely Wellness Coach Andrea and the rest is history!</p><p>“I’m falling in love with the journey and hope you will support me as much as you can.”</p><p>She shared on social media: “I know this may sound a bit corny but I’m so happy doing @ww.uk as it’s given me the confidence to just embrace myself fully.</p><p><strong>DON’T MISS</strong></p><p>“I never really liked my face without make-up as I have dark patches but now I’m totally loving myself and falling in love with me while I’m away on holiday.</p><p>“I don’t have to have make-up to be beautiful because I’m beautiful full stop. Yes! Please join my crusade of loving yourself!”</p><p>The presenter explained her diet changes included eating more healthy meals, fruits and vegetables as well as increasing the water intake.</p><p>“One [I have changed] is drinking more water,” Alison said.</p><p>Alison had a pre-diabetic condition in 2020 which was a major eye-opener for the presenter since her late mother suffered with diabetes and she died in February 2020 after a battle with liver and lung cancer.</p><p>“I’ve never had health issues until then. It scared me because my mum had diabetes and I want to be there for my son.</p><p>“I decided to do something about it. I go for walks and I cut out sugar. I feel a lot better. I’m not weighing myself, because you feel it in your clothes. I’m no longer pre-diabetic, and I’m doing really well.</p><p>“I’ve been doing that for a while now, and you know something? I feel fitter, I feel stronger. I might not look perfect yet, but personally, I’m perfect, full stop!” she explained.</p><p>Post source: <a href=#>Express</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvApaCsp55itaK5zKilnWWnmraotNNmo6iro2LAta3RrGSipaCnsrS%2FyK%2BcZqyilru0ss6rpJqsmaS7bq3FrZyrZZSaw6K%2F05qroqaXYrmwv9Jo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
