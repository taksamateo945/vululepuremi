The firm then appealed, which delayed the deadline for compliance until late June.</p><p>Two days after that deadline passed, Cushman asked the judge to grant either a protective order or a time extension.</p><p>James’ office urged Engoron to reject that request for more time. Cushman replied that it is doing all it can to comply with the subpoenas.</p><p>On Tuesday, the judge sided with the attorney general’s office, saying he was “incredulous” as to why Cushman would wait until after its court-ordered deadline to ask for more time.</p><p>The firm’s lack of timeliness “is fatal to its motion” because it “fails to identify any good cause for filing its motion after its time to comply had already lapsed,” Engoron wrote.</p><p>But even if it had asked for an extension before the deadline, the judge wrote, Cushman’s motion “still fails on the merits” since it had already been unsuccessful in a previous attempt to quash the subpoenas.</p><p>Engoron acknowledged that the subpoenas require Cushman “to produce an enormous number of documents.”</p><p>But the law “allows for subpoenas of this breadth,” the judge wrote.</p><p>Cushman “has only itself to blame if it chose to treat the looming deadlines cavalierly,” Engoron added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK%2FUrJ%2BmmZ5ixKK3xJ%2BgnqSUYrWmuMNmoKdlk6S7tbHMqatmoZ5ivbO7wZ5kqJ5dmbyvrcudZK2qpaK9bq%2FOpqeapqlk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
