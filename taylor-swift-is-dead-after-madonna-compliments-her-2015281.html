"It's good to have princesses," the "Living for Love" singer said. "It means there's lot of pretty dresses around."</p><p>She then called out one specific pop superstar for her hits. "I like Taylor Swift," Madonna noted of the 25-year-old superstar, whose latest album title hails back to Madonna's first decade in the world spotlight. "I think she writes some really catchy pop songs. Can't get them out of my head."</p><p>Swift, who caught wind of Madonna's remarks, quoted the interview and added: "Thanks now I'm dead." Naturally, the "Blank Space" singer had more to add, following up with the hashtags "#HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH THIS #BE COOL TAYLOR STOP BEING EMBARRASSING."</p><p>Her zero-chill update is perhaps best explained by an interview with Graham Norton last fall, when Swift explained that her fans were particularly fond of the phrase, "I'm dead."</p><p>The singer, who admitted to cyberstalking her millions of followers, gushed about how excited her fans got when she invited a handful of them over to her home for secret listening sessions of her smash album 1989 before its scheduled release. "I love them so much," Swift gushed, "because they always talk about dying!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She then admitted to borrowing the phrase from her fans. "Those were so funny," Swift mused of their reactions. "I think I'm going to die. I'm just gonna die right here. Just dead."</p><p>The singer's adorable Tumblr update followed a tumultuous Tuesday, after her social media accounts <a href=#>were hacked</a>, and the offenders threatened to release personal nude photos.</p><p>Swift, though, cheekily responded later that afternoon, tweeting: "PS any hackers saying they have 'nudes'? Psssh you'd love that wouldn't you! Have fun photoshopping cause you got NOTHING." <a href=#>See what else she had to say to her hackers</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWZqHqlscCdZJqepJq%2FbrnAnaanppFisLC5z6Wgpp2eqcButMSrZGtoYWp%2FeX0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
