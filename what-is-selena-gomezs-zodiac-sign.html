Her birthday makes her a Cancer sun sign, but just barely as she was born on the final day of the Cancer zodiac cycle. According to Allure, Cancer is a water sign that is known for being ruled by the moon. The crabs of the zodiac are very focused on their home and comfort and are known for creating safe havens for themselves inside the walls of their living spaces. The sign can also be highly emotional so beware of their possible mood swings. However, Cancers are known for their likable personalities and often display fierce loyalty and commitment to those they cherish most.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Sadly, Cancers often keep their feelings inside and struggle with them internally (via Co-Star Astrology). The sign is often afraid to open up about their feelings and can sometimes believe that showing emotion will be perceived as weak. Cancers are also said to love sticking to a routine and enjoy the predictability of their everyday lives, so it’s not shocking that they aren’t big fans of surprises.&nbsp;Today notes that Cancers are also hard workers and it’s often important to them to be thought of successful supporters to their families. They’re also known for falling in and out of love quickly so expect relationships changes during their dating years.</p><p>Post source: <a href=#>The List</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5iWwW610maqnqSVo65us86mnLOrXa%2B8pbXAnGSsoZejfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
