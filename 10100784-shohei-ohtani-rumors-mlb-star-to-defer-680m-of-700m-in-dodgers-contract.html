That means the money will be paid out from 2034 to 2043 without interest.</p><p>The reasoning is so the Dodgers can continue adding to their roster with the hopes of competing for championships in the immediate future.</p><p>While that is quite the financial sacrifice from the superstar in the coming years, Ardaya noted he was the one who suggested it. What's more, he is making approximately $50 million annually on off-field endorsements and endeavors, which will surely ease the burden of waiting for the majority of his money from the new contract.</p><p>From the Dodgers' perspective, this will help them further work around the competitive balance tax and perhaps add pitchers such as Yoshinobu Yamamoto or Tyler Glasnow this offseason.</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeff Passan</a> called the development a "huge discount" for the Dodgers since the overall hit on the contract in terms of the competitive balance tax will be approximately $46 million per season.</p><p>Ohtani is clearly ready to start competing for World Series titles if he was willing to make such drastic deferrals on his contract. While he was one of the best players in the league throughout his six years on the Los Angeles Angels, the team never made the playoffs.</p><p>The Dodgers are well positioned to not only make the playoffs but compete for multiple championships in the coming years. Their lineup will feature MVP candidates in Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, as well as notable players such as Max Muncy and Will Smith.</p><p>For now, pitching remains a question mark since Ohtani will not take the mound in 2024 following elbow surgery. Dodgers legend Clayton Kershaw is also a free agent, and the team's ability to add a potential top-notch starter like Yamamoto or Glasnow could make the difference between a title or early playoff exit.</p><p>That is why Ohtani's decision to defer so much of his contract is so notable as the Dodgers are expected to be factors in the pursuit of multiple other star players.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGWEeYCMrJ%2BooJWeerC005qlomWiqrqwvtJmpKWaXajBor6MraZmnJWbsrN5lXFnpmWfm3p4fI%2BmZKKmXZm8pbPEq6pmm5%2BjwbOtwq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
