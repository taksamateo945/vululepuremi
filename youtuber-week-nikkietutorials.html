Nikkie is known for truly going outside the box with her makeup looks and wowing her audience with her creativity. Her passion has earned her an army of 5.4M+ subscribers, making her one of the most well known beauty gurus on YouTube. &nbsp;She even snagged a collaboration with Too Faced Cosmetics, creating her very own ‘<a href=#>The Power of Makeup’ palette</a>.</p><h3>Why You Should Watch NikkieTutorials</h3><p>If you are a lover of makeup, you are seriously missing out if you are not subscribed to Nikkie’s channel. Nikkie has a video for every type of makeup lover out there. She has tutorials for subtle, everyday,&nbsp;and makeup for those not quite adventurous when it comes to makeup. She also has tutorials for high glam looks for those wanting to try something new or just want to see how it’s done. Nikkie is also very current on all the new releases of makeup and is very true and honest with her viewers on her opinions of products. Another reason to love NikkieTutorials is that she reminds her viewers that makeup does not define your beauty and that anyone is beautiful with or without it. Nikkie helped influence the #thepowerofmakeup challenge where people do only half their face of makeup to make a statement that yes, makeup does make a dramatic change, but your own skin is just as beautiful.</p><h3>5 NikkieTutorials Videos You Need to Watch</h3><h3>The Power of MAKEUP!</h3><p>As we said above, Nikkie’s most viral video is her The Power of Makeup video.
