Most recently, Sterling was caught on record saying some highly unsavory comments in an apparent argument with a woman. The recording, which was released by TMZ on Friday, features a man believed to be Sterling who&nbsp;asks a woman identified as his girlfriend, V. Stiviano (who is half African American and half Mexican), not to publicly associate with African Americans.</p><p>Here are 10 things you didn’t know about the Donald Sterling:</p><p>1. He was born Donald Tokowitz in 1933 to immigrant parents and&nbsp;grew up in the low-income neighborhood of Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles.</p><p>2. He ended up attending Southwestern Law School, which he paid for by working as a salesman at a furniture shop. There he met and eventually married the owner’s daughter, Rochelle.&nbsp;The pair have been married for over 50 years and have three children together.&nbsp; It should also be noted that they are separated and his wife has filed a lawsuit against his girlfriend Victoria Stiviano.</p><p>3. When he was in his 20s, he changed his last name to Sterling; a name he believed people would have “confidence” in, a former coworker told Los Angeles magazine.</p><p>4. Sterling began his career as a personal injury and divorce lawyer in 1961, and gradually moved into real estate where he amassed his fortune, which Forbes estimates to be $1.9 billion.</p><p>5. He acquired the San Diego Clippers in 1981, paying $12.7 million for the entire team.</p><p>6. During his time as the owner of the franchise, he’s encountered numerous lawsuits, most of which were settled privately, including a harassment case like the one in 1996 by a former employee named Christine Jaksy.</p><p>7. &nbsp;The NAACP, which Sterling donates to, handed Sterling his first award in 2009.</p><p>8. Earlier in 2003, he was involved in a federal suit in which he was accused of unfairly evicting minorities from his properties.</p><p>9. Former Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor filed&nbsp;a&nbsp;discrimination suit, which claimed, among other things, that Sterling repeatedly told him his team was fielding “poor African American boys from the South … playing for a white coach.” The case was later thrown out by a jury in 2011.</p><p>10. A sworn testimony by his property supervisor alleged Sterling made racially charged comments against African Americans and Mexicans.&nbsp; The case was resolved in a private settlement in 2005,&nbsp;according to ESPN.</p><p>Photo by Robert Mora/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWknbavs9Jmm6Kcnql6rLrOsGSdp56WuaV50q2cq6SZo7Rw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
