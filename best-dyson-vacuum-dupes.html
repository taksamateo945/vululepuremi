The reliable, well-designed appliances have become wildly popular for making it easier to tidy up the kitchen, get dirt out of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>the living room</a>, and keep your home looking tidy. But all of that high performance also comes with a pretty high price tag that puts them out of most budgets. Fortunately, there are some options that offer plenty of the same functionality at a fraction of the price. Read on for the best Dyson vacuum dupes, according to retail experts.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Sam's Club Sells a Cheap Anthropologie Cabinet Dupe—Is It Just as Good?</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/black-decker-powerseries-cordless-vacuum.jpg><p>Dyson has become something of a household name thanks to the success of its products. But in the wake of its popularity boom, other trusted companies have brought their own versions to the market, including the Black+Decker with its <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-POWERSERIES-Cordless-BSV2020P/dp/B07WD6S4QR&source=gmail&ust=1692280737543000&usg=AOvVaw1sVU2heEy9Xms80Vge-meB">Powerseries Extreme</a>.</p><p>According to <strong>Julie Ramhold</strong>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>consumer analyst</a> with DealNews.com, the model comes highly recommended and is decently rated with 4.1 stars on Amazon from nearly 6,500 reviews. "This is a very recognizable brand as well, so if you're a little hesitant to purchase the no-names that may be getting attention, this is a good compromise," she says.</p><p>She also notes that while the price may vary depending on where you're shopping, it's usually around $156. The low price is remarkable given its capabilities.</p><p>"The great thing about this model is that it's ideal for hard surfaces or carpet, so it can pull double duty better than some upright models," she says. "The battery supposedly has a runtime of 55 minutes, so it may be best for smaller carpeted areas or homes with one or two carpeted rooms as opposed to those that are mostly carpet."</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>5 Best KitchenAid Mixer Dupes for Less, Retail Experts Say</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/zokervacuum-cordless-vacuum.jpg><p>Shopping online can make it challenging to know what you're getting when it comes to quality—especially when you're looking for a deal. But experts say the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>ZokerVacuum Cordless Vacuum</a> stands out as a reliable option from a lesser-known brand.</p><p>"This ZokerVacuum features a detachable battery and comes with three extra attachments for different types of cleaning," says <strong>Samantha Landau</strong>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>consumer expert</a> at TopCashback.com. "Reviewers noted that this vacuum is easier to use than a similar Dyson vacuum as you do not have to hold the button down when using."</p><p>The best part? The ZokerVacuum retails for $189.99 on Amazon, while Dyson's options start at $949.99—meaning it'll cost you $700 less.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Walmart and Target Have a Secret Hiding Spot for Clearance Items</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/kenmore-brushless-cordless-stick-vacuum.jpg><p>Not all modern vacuums are made equal, but just like any other appliance, how well they work isn't always tied to how much they cost. Fortunately, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Kenmore Brushless Cordless Stick Vacuum</a> can still provide performance at a lower price than the Dyson.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"This is another very recognizable brand and comes in around $179.99, which is still definitely affordable as far as these household appliances go," says Ramhold. "It's another model suitable for all floor types, so it's especially great for quick cleaning jobs in between larger deep cleans to keep things tidy."</p><p>She points out that the model is lightweight at less than six pounds, but that may come at a cost: The battery runtime is only 40 minutes.</p><p>"But it does boast the EasyReach wand feature to help get into tighter spaces, and the capacity is supposed to be decently large to prevent having to make frequent stops to empty the vacuum while using it," Ramhold says.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>7 Home Stores That Sell the Best Quality Couches</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/shark-stratos-cordless-vacuum.jpeg><p>Dyson may be one of the most respected vacuum brands on the market, but it's far from the only option. Products like the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum</a> show how quickly alternatives to the high-priced brands have kept up with the competition.</p><p>"Shark is a rival brand for Dyson, but often their products are much cheaper with the same vacuuming capabilities," says Landau. "Shark's Stratos Cordless Vacuum—which claims to have the most powerful suction of any Shark product—currently sells for $499.99, with 4.2 stars on the company's website and reviewers mentioning a long battery life and strong suction. Compared to similar options from Dyson, you're saving over $400—plus, you're still getting a highly reputable brand-name product."</p><p><strong>For more shopping advice delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/eureka-lightweight-cordless-vacuum.jpg><p>The trend in vacuums may be moving away from bulky bags and cumbersome cables, but the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Eureka Lightweight Cordless Vacuum Cleaner</a> shows some legacy companies aren't trapped in the past.</p><p>"Yet another recognizable brand, this model also has 4.1 stars on Amazon, but that comes from more than 25,000 reviews, so there's some weight behind these ratings for sure," says Ramhold. "This vacuum weighs 6.4 pounds and actually has three different modes with different runtimes to help you keep things neat—MAX, MID, and Eco-Handheld," which will give you 10, 20, and 45 minutes of runtime, respectively.</p><p>It's also much more affordable than a Dyson, priced at around $150. "This particular model offers a 'headlight' and lays completely flat to make it easier to clean in dark spaces under furniture," she says. "And there are fingertip controls to easily change modes even mid-vacuum."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmm52jqXqlxdKopWaukZjCtrmMnaypnaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
