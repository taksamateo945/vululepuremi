"There’s nothing like having someone that makes you laugh, that encourages you, and motivates you…He’s such an incredible person and they say there’s always a great man behind a great woman and I say the same for him. He’s been that great motivation behind everything I do.”</p><p>In an exclusive clip obtained by <a href=#>E! News</a>, the Cheetah Girls alum shocked her co-hosts and revealed “I’m engaged!” by whipping out the massive sparkler on her ring finger on The Real. Bailon went on to gush to the table that her hubby-to-be popped the question at dinner in front of their family and closest friends — with a box of carrots!</p><p>In Monday’s episode, Bailon explains that Santiago, Senior Vice President of Artist Management at Roc Nation, gave her the box of the vegetables before saying, “Well, since you said yes to those carrots…,” while getting down on one knee to offer her the actual carats.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the news, Bailon shared an adorable Instagram with her love, showing off her new bling. “YES! @kodaklens I will soon be Mrs. Lenny S.,” she wrote alongside the snap.</p><p>Bailon’s relationship with Santiago comes after she dated <strong>Kris Jenner</strong>’s only son Rob from 2007-2009. “It's common knowledge that he cheated on me," Bailon told Latina magazine this past September, almost six years after she and <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>’s brother called it quits. "It always bothered me that people were like, 'Pero, why couldn’t you forgive him?' Why are women always the ones who have to forgive? If you cheated on a man, he would be like, 'You're disgusting, and I want nothing to do with you.' But women, we're supposed to be like, 'He messed up. He made a mistake.'"</p><p>Following the honest interview, Bailon <a href=#>got slammed</a> by Rob’s sisters <strong>Khloe </strong>and Kim. "So sad when people try to kick my brother when he is down #FamilyForever… Funny how she says being with a Kardashian hurt her career yet the only reason she has this article is bc she is talking about a Kardashian,” they both tweeted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJidqpmau6%2BxjJuYoqSfo3qmusaanp6cXam8brjOp56toZ2aeqO72J%2Bpop2emXqtsc2nsGarkaPBqq3GqGRraGFqgnM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
