No one is perfect, of course, but what is it that makes a potential partner so off-putting? Is it that they're overly critical of others? Or perhaps it could be their temper? To find out more, we spoke to astrologers who broke down the least desirable zodiac signs. Keep reading to find out who you may want to steer clear of, from harmlessly high-strung to emotionally repellent signs.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Unfriendliest Zodiac Sign, According to Astrologers</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/over-critical.jpg><p>Virgos are very analytical and detail-oriented. "While this can be a great asset in many areas of life, it can also lead to Virgos being overly critical of themselves and others, which can be off-putting to some people," shares <strong>Rachel Clare</strong>, an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>astrologer at Mysticsense</a>."</p><p>As the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>perfectionists of the zodiac</a>, they may nitpick how you fold the laundry, get anxious and angry when you're five minutes late, and generally have a hard time relaxing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/iStock-1304127562.jpg><p>Not unlike Virgos, Capricorns can be seen as undesirable partners because of their type-A ways. "This is partly due to the fact that Capricorns are ruled by Saturn, the planet of discipline, responsibility, and restriction," notes Clare.</p><p>This makes them <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>extremely hardworking</a> and goal-oriented, but it also makes them inflexible and uptight in their personal lives.</p><p>Don't be shocked if they miss your birthday dinner because they stayed late at the office or if they get frustrated with you because you changed the furniture layout in the living room.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Most Incompatible Zodiac Signs, According to an Astrologer</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/couple-arguing-woman-pushing-man-away.jpg><p>Scorpio is complex, to say the least. "Some love them, some hate them, and others are a bit intimidated by them," Clare bluntly states.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>As a water sign, they're highly emotional and passionate, but they are also <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>very intense</a>, secretive, and, at times, manipulative, safeguarding their vulnerable side at all costs.</p><p>Because it takes so much work to break down their walls, "people may want to avoid getting too close to Scorpios and thus, they can be perceived as less desirable," adds Clare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/first-date-flowers-girl-rolling-eyes.jpg><p>Aquarius is the free-spirited <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>eccentric of the zodiac</a>, ruled by Uranus, "the planet of innovation, rebellion, and unpredictability," notes Clare.</p><p>She says some people may find their eccentricities difficult to connect with and adds that their idealistic views "can make it difficult for them to compromise or see other perspectives."</p><p>But perhaps more than this, it's their aloofness that causes others to not desire them. "Aquarius loves their freedom and does not want to tie themselves into a relationship," says <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>psychic reader and astrologer</a> <strong>Emily Newman</strong>. In fact, Newman says that if they suspect a relationship is turning serious, they'll run away.</p><p><strong>For more astrology content delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/shutterstock_677813476.jpg><p>"Aries' reputation for being impulsive, decisive, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>occasionally selfish</a> may lead some people to view them as one of the least desirable signs, whether romantically or platonically," says Clare.</p><p>Not only does their fiery personality leave them famously short-tempered, but it also makes them aggressively competitive, even with those they love.</p><p>Newman explains that if their partner is upstaging them, Aries will get jealous and act out. Though their angry outbursts typically don't last long, they "can surely hurt their partner," Newman adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/iStock-1167906681.jpg><p>"Some people absolutely love Cancers for their nurturing and compassionate nature, while others may see them as one of the least desirable signs due to their <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>perceived moodiness</a> and clinginess," explains Clare.</p><p>It all boils down to the fact that they're ruled by the Moon, the planet of emotion and intuition. "They tend to be very family-oriented and protective of their loved ones, but this can also lead to them being overly sensitive or defensive," notes Clare, who adds that they also hold onto grudges.</p><p>"They are too sensitive to handle most zodiac signs," notes Newman, pointing to their mood swings. "They can talk for hours and hours or may ignore you for months and months."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmpZ2RqMFusMSsoKuZkqGybsbOnaCam12otqi6jKecsKtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
