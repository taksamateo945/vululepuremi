The Joker alum was spotted hanging out at the Alamo Drafthouse in downtown Los Angeles meeting up with moviegoers, posing for selfies, and even answering some questions while sporting a gray sweatshirt.</p><p>Deadline reported that they didn’t know whether he had bought his own ticket, although, not like it matters, considering Joker smashed the opening weekend record for October. As it was previously reported, Joker earned $93 million in its opening weekend, making it the highest-grossing film for October, ever.</p><p>It beat out competition like Venom as well as It: Chapter Two. Around the globe, additionally, Joker has earned $234 million. As most know, this is a huge moment for Mr. Phoenix, who hasn’t had a leading role since 2013’s Her, as well as the following year’s Inherent Vice.</p><p>Regardless, Joker was the biggest box office movie for Joaquin Phoenix ever, even beating out other big movies including Walk The Line, Gladiator, as well as Signs – in which he co-starred alongside Mel Gibson.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1w0zlMgovM/</p><p>There’s no question that Joker benefitted from some of the surrounding controversies, including warnings from the United States Army that the film could incite or increase the risk of mass shootings for the way in which Joker supposedly glamorizes social pariahs.</p><p>In fact, additional police officers from both the LAPD and NYPD were stationed around movie theaters in the respective cities. Responding to some of these claims directly, Joaquin Phoenix stated that it’s easy for human beings to look for the evil of others, and always assume someone else is the wrong-doer.</p><p>However, it’s important to look inside oneself and understand the way in which one can also become a bad person. Joaquin stated that it’s much harder – but ultimately more fruitful – to try and empathize with others to the best of one’s ability.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The director of the movie, Todd Phillips, also addressed the claims, stating that it was merely a movie based on a fictional universe.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeapK6ywcinZKmgn5q7qsSMppiknaNiwLa%2Bz6ugrJ1dlr2xscCrnKeblWKutXnLmmStoJWWwaa%2BjJ2sq6GenHqru8qeqWark6eyprrIp55ma2JshHmCjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
